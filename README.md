# monster-hp-tracker
This page was created to enrich and facilitate combat tracking for D&D (Dungeons & Dragons) DM (Dungeon Master - the person who manages the game experience).

During combat, a DM has to control several monsters and each monster has it's individual health bar (which determines how much damage a monster can take before it dies or go out of combat). 

Monster HP tracker allows to simultaneously control these monster's health in order to not lose track of them.

The page was created in 2015 and enables the use of [DnDAppFiles](https://github.com/ceryliae/DnDAppFiles) xmls.
